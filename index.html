      <p>My name is Kathryn Wrynn and I am a senior at Pascack Hills High School. I will be continuing my education at Bucknell University as a computer 
      science and engineering major following a pre-med track.</p>
      <p>During high school, I have volunteered at:

      <p>In addition, I am part of my school's FRC (First Robotics Competition) team, The Pascack Pi-oneers where I am captain of the safety subdivision.
        I have also participated in Taekwondo since fourth grade and have earned my Third Degree Black Belt. Currently, I am working towards my Girl Scout
